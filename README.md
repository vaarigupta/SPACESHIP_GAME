# SPACESHIP_GAME
 I have created a basic game in which a spaceship starts moving on pressing the arrow keys 
 Arrow Keys :-
*  **Up - Moves Up**
 * **Down - Moves Down**
 * **Right -  Moves Right**
 * **Left - Moves Left**

Therea are Folders for this ->
1. Depicting with the Button
2. Depicting with the image( The Main Code)
